# React Project Refresher

Your task is to build an app which lists information on the planets in our solar system.ü™ê

## Pre lecture Tasks:

1. Use the following wireframe to plan your app. Consider the different components this app would be made of; think of which we could make reusable. Eventually the planet data will update so we'll probably want to hold it in state. Sketch out a component tree diagram to help illustrate your decisions.  

<img src="wireframe.jpg" alt="react app wireframe" style="width:300px;"/>

2. Using your plan, build up your individual components. You can use the following fake data to initialise your state. Don't worry about updating it just yet.

```js
[
  {
    planet_id: 1,
    planet_name: "planet a",
    au_from_sun: "1",
    type: "gas",
    moon_count: "0",
  },
  {
    planet_id: 2,
    planet_name: "planet b",
    au_from_sun: "2",
    type: "rock",
    moon_count: "4",
  },
];
```

You do not need to consider CSS right now, just ensure you are able _hydrate_ your components with the data provided.


**Optional Further Task**

3.  Think about how you might choose to present the data. Presenting information to a user as `label:value` like depicted in the wireframe is not very inspiring. Think about how you present the data for each planet with the card. This [article](https://www.refactoringui.com/previews/labels-are-a-last-resort) is a very good read on how to refactor the UI. You can consider using CSS here.

## Post Lecture Tasks

1. Time to remove your hard coded data! We want to fetch the most up to date planets every time we load open the app. Make use of the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) to request this data and update state with the up to date planets.

_What value(s) will need to exist in the dependency array? Why?_

2. Data fetches may take some time. Make use of the the is loading pattern to let the user know that something is happening whilst they wait for the data.

3. Data fetches are common in applications. There's a danger that the logic will bloat our components and maybe be useable elsewhere. Extract out the data fetch logic to a separate file to tidy up our project a bit.
